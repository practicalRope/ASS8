#font
VCR_OSD_MONO_1.001.ttf was changed to Retron2000.ttf.
It flows better, but it also is more readable. It does on the other hand not break with the theme, which is a must.

#intro (who is cluster buster?)
Iframes (embeded music players), changed from a musicplayer to image only music player style embed.
This should help it flow with the text, while also feeling more relevant.
